### Suggestions

#### 🟠 HIGH `S001` - Logic
**File:** `src/suppressions.rs` (lines 1-251)

The removal of the suppression system in favor of a rejection system changes the behavior of how findings are managed. This could lead to previously suppressed findings being re-reported if not properly handled in the new system.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Ensure that the new rejection system correctly handles all cases that the suppression system did, including edge cases like expired suppressions and content hash changes.
```

#### 🟡 MEDIUM `S002` - Documentation
**File:** `README.md` (lines 94-319)

The documentation in the README has been updated to reflect the new rejection system, but it may not fully cover all aspects of the change from suppressions to rejections. This could lead to confusion for users familiar with the old system.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Expand the documentation to include a detailed explanation of how the rejection system works, including examples and a comparison to the old suppression system.
```
