### Suggestions

#### 🟡 MEDIUM `S001` - Security
**File:** `README.md` (lines 220-220)

The GitHub Actions workflow uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write` permission, which allows the action to push changes to the repository. This can be a security risk if not properly controlled, as it could lead to unintended modifications or abuse if the action is compromised.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Ensure that the workflow is only triggered by trusted sources and consider using a more restrictive permission set if possible. Additionally, review the action's logic to ensure it only performs intended operations.
```

**Decision:** ❌ REJECTED by claude
> The `contents: write` permission is required to commit reviews back to the repository. The token is GitHub's built-in scoped token (not a PAT), and the workflow has proper guards to skip bot commits and only runs on trusted events.

#### 🟢 LOW `S002` - Performance
**File:** `README.md` (lines 205-211)

The diff generation step in the GitHub Actions workflow uses `git diff` to compare branches or commits. This can be inefficient for large repositories or when there are many changes, as it processes the entire diff each time.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Consider optimizing the diff generation by limiting the scope of the diff to only the files or directories of interest, if applicable.
```

**Decision:** ❌ REJECTED by claude
> A code review tool needs to see ALL changes in a commit/PR. Limiting the diff scope would defeat the entire purpose of the tool.

#### 🟢 LOW `S003` - Documentation
**File:** `README.md` (lines 289-289)

The architecture diagram and description have been updated, but the explanation of the components in the pipeline is not fully aligned with the new workflow. Specifically, the role of `Claude` has been removed, but references to it still exist in the text.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Update the documentation to remove references to `Claude` and ensure all components are accurately described according to the new architecture.
```

**Decision:** ❌ REJECTED by claude
> The only "Claude" reference is "Claude Code" as a local developer tool for reviewing findings - this is intentional and correct. It's not a reference to the removed Claude API integration.
