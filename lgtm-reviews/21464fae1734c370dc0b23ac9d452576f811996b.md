### Suggestions

#### 🟠 HIGH `S001` - Logic
**File:** `src/adapters/codex.rs` (lines 195-197)

The `build_response_format` function previously included a `JsonSchema` object to define the structure of the expected JSON response. Removing this schema could lead to incorrect or unexpected JSON structures being generated, as there is no longer a strict schema validation in place.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Consider reintroducing the `JsonSchema` or an equivalent validation mechanism to ensure the JSON response adheres to the expected structure.
```

**Decision:** ❌ REJECTED by claude
> Removed json_schema because OpenAI API was returning 500 errors with structured outputs. The json_object mode with format specified in the prompt is a valid workaround. Deserialization will still fail if the response is malformed.
