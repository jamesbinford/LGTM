    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa - Marvin Attack timing sidechannel
    # Severity: Medium (5.9)
    # Status: No fix available as of 2025-12
    #
    # This vulnerability requires:
    # - Direct access to RSA decryption operations
    # - Ability to measure precise timing of decryption
    # - Many repeated measurements
    #
    # Impact on this project:
    # - rsa is a transitive dependency from sqlx-macros-core and jsonwebtoken
    # - We don't directly use RSA decryption in a way that exposes timing
    # - GitHub API authentication uses the library internally
    #
    # Will be removed when upstream provides a fix.
