### Suggestions

#### 🟠 HIGH `S001` - Security
**File:** `src/suppressions.rs` (lines 354-354)

The use of the MD5 hashing algorithm is insecure due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. It should not be used for security-sensitive operations.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Consider using a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3.
```

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM `S002` - Performance
**File:** `src/suppressions.rs` (lines 354-354)

The `get_content_hash` function reads the entire file content into memory and then processes it. This could be inefficient for large files.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Consider reading only the necessary lines from the file instead of loading the entire file into memory.
```

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM `S003` - Logic
**File:** `src/suppressions.rs` (lines 354-354)

The `get_content_hash` function assumes that the file exists and is readable. If the file does not exist or is not readable, the function will return `None`, which might not be handled properly by the caller.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Ensure that the caller of `get_content_hash` properly handles the `None` case, or add error handling within the function to provide more context.
```

---

#### 🟢 LOW `S004` - Documentation
**File:** `src/suppressions.rs` (lines 354-354)

The `get_content_hash` function lacks documentation. It is important to document the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.

**Proposed fix:**
```
Add a doc comment to the `get_content_hash` function explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.
```
